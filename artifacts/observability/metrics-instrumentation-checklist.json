  "notes": [
    "All metrics should follow Prometheus naming conventions",
    "Histograms should use appropriate buckets for latency (e.g., .001, .005, .01, .05, .1, .5, 1, 5)",
    "Labels should be low-cardinality (avoid user IDs, use aggregates)",
    "Rate limits and errors should be counters, not gauges"
